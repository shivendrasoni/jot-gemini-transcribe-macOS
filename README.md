## What it is

Hold `fn`, say the thing, let go. A moment later your words are in the app you
were already using — punctuated, filler words removed, cleaned up. No window to switch
to, no transcript to copy, no account to make.

It is deliberately small: a menu bar icon, a pill at the bottom of your screen
while you talk, and a History window that proves nothing was ever lost.

## The gestures

| Gesture | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| **Hold `fn`** | Records while held. Release and the text lands at your cursor. |
| **`fn` + tap `Space`** | Hands-free: keeps recording after you let go. Tap `fn` to finish. |
| **`fn` + `⌥1`** | Runs that Transform over the dictation before it lands. |
| **`fn` + hold `⌥`** | Shows the wheel of Transforms. Arrows to choose, release `⌥` to apply, `Esc` to close. |
| **`Esc`** | Cancels. Anything over 10 seconds is still kept in History. |

The key is rebindable in Settings → General if `fn` is spoken for.

## What makes it different

**It follows a change of mind.** Say *"let's meet at 1pm — actually, no, make it
2pm"* and Jot writes **"Let's meet at 2pm."** That is the whole pitch, and
onboarding makes you do it once so you believe it.

**It never loses your words.** Audio goes to disk from the first millisecond, so
a crash, a `kill -9`, or a flat battery costs you nothing — the recording is
recovered on next launch. Offline, dictations queue and land when you reconnect.
Every failure is retryable from History. Release the key mid-word and it keeps
listening until you actually stop.

**It is private by architecture.** Your voice goes from your Mac straight to the
Gemini API with *your* key. No middleman server, no account, no analytics, no
screenshots, no keystroke logging — one network host, and you can read every
line of the code that talks to it. See [PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md).

**Your prompts, one keystroke in.** A Transform is a prompt you save once and arm
mid-sentence: hold `fn`, tap `⌥1`, and the dictation goes through *Polish* before
a single character is typed. Nothing is ever rewritten in place, because nothing
has been written yet. Jot ships with Polish, Prompt Engineer and Simplify; write
your own in Settings → Transforms and bind it to any `⌥` chord. If a Transform
fails, the pill says so and inserts what you dictated — it can cost you the
polish, never the words.

**Your jargon, spelled right.** Names and product terms go in the Dictionary and
ride along with the audio, so the model hears "Kubernetes" instead of guessing
"cooper netties" — corrected at the source, not patched afterwards. Tone matching for
email vs. chat vs. code is available too, in Settings → Dictation.

## Install

1. Download the latest `Jot-x.y.z.dmg` from [Releases](../../releases/latest).
2. Drag Jot into **Applications** and launch it from there — apps run from a
   mounted disk image are sandboxed by macOS and the permissions you grant will
   not stick.

Setup takes about two minutes and the app walks you through it:

1. **Paste a Gemini API key** — get one at
   [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). It is stored in your
   macOS Keychain and only ever sent to Google.
2. **Allow the microphone** — say hello and it advances by itself.
3. **Allow Accessibility** — macOS requires this for any app that types into
   another app.
4. **Hold `fn` and talk.**

**Cost:** you pay Google for what you dictate at
[Gemini API pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing); a free tier exists and a
typical dictation is a few seconds of audio. Jot itself is free and has no
account.

**Model:** Jot runs on Gemini's specialist transcription model,
`gemini-3.5-transcribe`. Your key needs access to it; setup tells you up front if
it does not, instead of failing on your first dictation.

## How it works

```
fn down ─▶ capture (CAF on disk from t=0) ─▶ fn up ─▶ FLAC ─▶ Gemini transcribe
                                                                    │
   cursor ◀─ insert (AX → paste → clipboard) ◀─ [validate ◀─ tone pass] ─┘
                                              (optional, off by default)
                                                    │
                                              History (SQLite)
```

A few decisions worth knowing about, because they are what make it feel solid:

- **The capture graph is pre-warmed while idle**, so a key press only pays
  `engine.start()` — 20-40ms instead of 75-150ms. Preparing is not recording: no
  audio flows and no mic indicator appears until you actually hold the key.
- **The mic drains one buffer past the stop**, because the audio tap only
  delivers whole ~100ms chunks and tearing down immediately threw away the tail
  of your last word.
- **Insertion is a ladder**: Accessibility API first (no clipboard involved), then
  a guarded paste that restores your clipboard, then a "copied — press ⌘V" chip.
  It never blind-pastes into an app that stole focus mid-flight.
- **A validation gate** guards the optional tone pass, catching the classic failure where the model *answers*
  your audio instead of transcribing it, and falls back to the raw transcript.
- **The paths that can lose words are tested.** `JotCore` is a headless Swift
  package holding the state machine, hotkey grammar, audio, transcription,
  formatting, insertion and history — so the failure modes above are exercised
  without launching the app.

The full design specs — including the failure matrix the reliability work is
built from — are in [docs/design/](docs/design/).

## Development

Requires macOS 14+, Xcode 16+, and [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).
The `.xcodeproj` is generated, not checked in.

```bash
brew install xcodegen
./scripts/build.sh          # xcodegen generate + xcodebuild
./scripts/test.sh           # swift test on JotCore
open Jot.xcodeproj          # or work in Xcode
```

Debug builds sign ad-hoc, so a clean clone needs no Apple account, certificate,
or team membership — `./scripts/build.sh` works as-is. To build under your own
team instead: `./scripts/build.sh DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=XXXXXXXXXX`. Only release
builds (`scripts/release.sh`) need a real Developer ID.

```
App/            menu bar item, HUD pill, windows, design tokens, icon + sounds
JotCore/        all engine logic, headless and testable
  HotkeyEngine/     CGEventTap + the pure hold/lock/cancel grammar
  AudioEngine/      crash-safe CAF capture, device changes, prewarming
  TranscriptionClient/  Gemini calls, timeouts, retries, FLAC
  FormattingPipeline/   cleanup prompt, validation gate, dictionary rules
  InsertionEngine/      the AX → paste → clipboard ladder
  HistoryStore/         GRDB index, recovery, retry queue, retention
scripts/        build, test, icon, DMG, release
docs/           privacy, releasing, design specs, research
```

Useful while hacking:

```bash
# every surface is reachable headlessly
open "jot://settings/about"      # or /general /dictation /privacy /advanced
open "jot://history"  "jot://dictionary"  "jot://onboarding/5"

# watch it work
log show --last 5m --info --predicate 'subsystem == "com.ammaar.jot"'
```

Transcript text is logged as `private` and never appears in those logs.

### Releasing

`./scripts/release.sh` archives, signs with Developer ID, notarizes, staples,
and builds the installer DMG. It refuses to produce a shareable DMG that is not
notarized. See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for the certificate setup.
